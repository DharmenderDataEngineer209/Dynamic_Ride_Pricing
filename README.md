## Dynamic Ride Pricing System

      About the Project

          Ever wondered why ride prices can suddenly change? This project dives into dynamic pricing for ride-sharing services. It analyzes factors like demand, supply, and vehicle type to
          suggest adjusted ride costs. And yes, it even predicts prices based on user inputs!

          Here’s what we’re doing:

                1) Visualizing historical ride data.

                2) Implementing pricing strategies based on demand and supply.

                3) Predicting adjusted ride costs with machine learning.


      Key Features

          1) Interactive Data Visualizations:

                Scatter plots to explore relationships between ride duration and cost.

                Box plots comparing vehicle types and historical costs.

                Correlation heatmaps to uncover relationships in the data.

          2) Dynamic Pricing Implementation:

                Calculates demand and supply multipliers.

                Adjusts ride costs using thresholds for high and low demand or supply.

          3) Profitability Analysis:

                Identifies profitable and loss-making rides.

                Displays distribution with a clean donut chart.

          4) Machine Learning Prediction:

                Trains a Random Forest Regressor to predict adjusted ride costs.

                Provides user-friendly predictions based on input values.

          5) Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:

                Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical data.

                Ensures data is clean and ready for analysis.

      Skills Showcased

          Programming: Python for data handling, analysis, and visualization.

          Data Visualization: Using Plotly to create intuitive and interactive visuals.

      How It Works

          1. Exploring the Data

            Visualize relationships between key metrics.

            Identify patterns and trends.

          2. Adjusting Pricing

                Demand too high? Prices go up.

                Drivers are plentiful? Costs go down.

          3. Predicting Costs

                Input the number of riders, drivers, vehicle type, and ride duration.

                Get a predicted cost instantly.

      Setup

          Clone the repository:

                git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dynamic-ride-pricing.git

          Install the required libraries:
